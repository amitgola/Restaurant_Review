       "'This is an old-dark-house movie. A young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by Satan, where they run from and into one after another of an ill-assorted crew: a lady in distress, an ape, an ape-man, a midget, various odd-looking people, and (for some reason) two Chinese. They end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a \"Price Is Right\" sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. For my taste it\\\\\\'s too much of the same thing. The creeping around fun-house corridors is amusing for a while, then becomes repetitive. By comparison with Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy doing the same bit in two reels, it isn\\\\\\'t truly funny. It\\\\\\'s not frightening either, and apparently wasn\\\\\\'t intended to be: the household is too absurd. Most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat, and usually two--one that the characters are led to believe is real, and another for which it\\\\\\'s a cover. Here the cover isn\\\\\\'t to be taken seriously, and neither is what covered. A few moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it\\\\\\'s rather heavy fun. The novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and I think could have been played straight to better effect--and still could be.\\''"

    "    \"Okay, there are a ton of reviews here, what can I possibly add?<br /><br />I will try anyway. <br /><br />The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing. The sets, outdoor locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by Roger Rees. His understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. His is a difficult life, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /><br />The best part of course- is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said his portrayal too gruff. I couldn\\'t disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh, weren\\'t out of character. He is a terribly disillusioned man who\\'s heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth. <br /><br />During the flashbacks, it\\'s obvious that he isn\\'t all gruff. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he was totally gone, his partner Marley would never have come for his sake in the first place. And after all, we are none of us past hoping. I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer\\'s with Belle, you see him smile regretfully as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will go through life 'with a grin on my face.' Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they get left on the editing room floor.<br /><br />And finally, his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy EVERY time I see it. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife are so apparent. And the line that gets me every time, 'God forgive me for the time I\\'ve wasted.' <br /><br />Bravi tutti!\"]"
